What is this build?
-------------------
This build is running against the latest Piwik beta version as no maximum
supported version in plugin.json is specified.

If you want to run this build against a fixed Piwik version, specifiy either a
maximum supported Piwik version in plugin.json like this:

'require": { "piwik": ">=2.15.0-rc1,<=2.15.0-rc1" },'

or specify a specifc "PIWIK_TEST_TARGET" Piwik version in your ".travis.yml".


Why is this important?
----------------------
Studies show that it is more efficient and best to find problems as early as
possible. In general we want to find possible problems as early as possible
and while you are working on the plugin anyway. This way you can make the
plugin compatible immediately instead of having to look into it in a few weeks
again. Also if you identify a bug in Piwik we can provide fixes much faster
and the build will automatically become green once we release a new beta.


What to do when this build fails?
---------------------------------
* Identify the cause of failure
* Report a bug in Piwik core https://github.com/piwik/piwik/issues in case
  it is a bug in Piwik
* Make your plugin compatible with the latest Piwik version
* If you cannot make your plugin compatible with the latest Piwik version,
  specify a maximum supported Piwik version in your plugin.json file like this:
  '"require": { "piwik": ">=2.15.0-rc1,<=2.15.0-rc1" },'
* If you need any help with this contact the Piwik core team
